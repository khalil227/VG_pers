So this is a homework from the "Interface Homme-Machine", it's about create a video game charcaters specification with Java Swing (Name, Gender, Height, Hair Color and age) and the only job for me is to make a gaming graphical user interface like just for gaming 

So i decided to choose Valorant as a game content

pretty simple hein !! anyway xD ... in this frame i deleted the menu bar (so i added the close and minimize by myself) and also used the yoru pic as my background and Added 3 Button and a label 
"Quitter" => like an exit button from title bar and it take ur confirmation first
"Information" => just an additional button to prove thats my work to teacher so i can avoid stealing my work xD 
"CrÃ©er" => it open a new frame which you can complete the form for creating a charcater

Our form with some requirements should probably ask for like u should write ur name just with string or ur height with numbers ...
..kinda like regex but its not the same , Example if you don't enter anything in this form and pressed "Valider" the program will warn u like here

else if you complete all the form it will show all your data

and then this data will be saved in our database which i used MySQL here, Just if we pressed the button "Agent List" it'll give us an indication

if we're following the indication here's what u got

and if we check in MySQL Shell, we will find everything work good
